# Understanding Global Happiness: Insights from the World Happiness Report

## Project Overview
This project explores global happiness trends using data from the World Happiness Report (WHR), spanning the years 2015 to 2020. The analysis delves into the key factors influencing happiness, such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. Additionally, the project investigates regional differences and historical trends to provide actionable insights for policymakers and researchers.

## Motivation
Happiness is a cornerstone of societal well-being, and understanding its drivers can inform strategies to improve quality of life and reduce inequality. This project aims to:

Identify factors contributing to regional happiness disparities.
Analyze how economic, social, and governance elements influence happiness.
Uncover trends and patterns to address challenges faced by less-happy regions.

## Key Features
1. Data Preparation
Combined datasets from multiple years for consistency.
Preprocessed data by:
Cleaning missing values and handling duplicates.
Reclassifying regions for better granularity.
Ensuring variables were in the appropriate format.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted visualizations to explore relationships between happiness and predictor variables:
Scatter plots for GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy.
Histograms for happiness score distribution.
Examined trends and patterns to validate assumptions for regression modeling.
3. Regression Modeling
Developed and validated multiple regression models to predict happiness scores.
Included interaction models to explore compound effects between variables.
Evaluated assumptions such as linearity, normality, and multicollinearity.
4. Insights and Findings
Positive correlations were observed for GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy with happiness.
Freedom to make life choices emerged as the most impactful predictor.
Diminishing returns were noted at higher levels of GDP and social support.
Regional differences highlighted cultural and societal influences on happiness.
